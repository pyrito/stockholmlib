			h1#title Stockholm Public Library
			p Welcome to my blog for my ARC 308 class at UT Austin (under the great Lawrence Speck!) Below I have more information regarding my scavenger hunt topic, the Stockholm Public Library, a hallmark of Swedish architecture and a combination of various architectural styles.

			h2#overview Overview & Plans
			p The Stockholm Public Library is a library building situated in the urban center of Stockholm, Sweden. The building was designed by famous Swedish architect, Gunnar Asplund, and was established in 1928. The purpose of the building (crucial to its time) was to provide the Swedish a place to educate themselves about the knowings of the world. It was meant to proliferate knowledge and spread the notion that intellect lead to power. Thus, the primary users would be the citizens of the city from all age groups and the secondary users would be tourists and other outsiders. The library is surrounded by bustling city streets as well as a large park.

			p Above are the architectural plans for the building that was designed by Gunnar Asplund. Originally, the building was meant to have a rounded dome on the top with the ancilliary buildings as as support. However, the design was too far-fetched and Asplund had a new idea of using simple, geometric shapes for the design (this topic will be touched upon later).

			figcaption The following album shows the interior of the library. An interesting fact is that the rotunda shape of the interior was inspired by Claude Nicholas Ledoux’s Rontonde de la Villette. 
			p The interior of the building tends to be a breathtaking experience for many. As you enter the building, you are welcomed by an enveloping atmosphere of books, books, and more books! The large rotunda enthralls the user with its size and demeanor. Although intimidating, the building welcomes learning and offers a wealth of knowledge (around 4 million books in total).

			p Below we see a few pictures of the exterior of the building,

			p The main building that we see was primarily made on a foundation of concrete blocks, built on top with brick walls in stucco orange and ocher rose. For support, iron beams and concrete were used. The ceilings are primarily covered with tar. Furthermore, granite was used for various pillars that surrounded the building. The interior of the building housed hardwoods native to Sweden.

			p To understand more about the Stockholm Public Library, I decided to watch a few videos to have a better feel for how the building was. After watching the video,  I was able to have a feel for the atmosphere that the architecture of the building provided. Firstly, I truly understood just how MASSIVE the rotunda of the building was. It’s hard to tell from the pictures but the video allowed me to have a good feeling for the scale of the interior as well as the fact that this library has a combined total of 4 million books, audio tapes, CDs, and audio books! All of the books were aligned on the curves of the rotunda’s edges with the interior filled with tables and computers for public use. Furthermore, there were three separate floors to access books along the border of the rotunda (so big!) The light was also positioned on the roof so perfectly that the entire area was lit up perfectly and provided an environment that gave a warm feeling and one that was conducive to peace and relaxation.

			p In addition to giving me an understanding of the interior of the building, the video gave me additional insight in understanding how the external environment influenced the atmosphere of the library. The bustling traffic of people, cars, motorbikes, and bicycles gave the library an urban feel and also made the library feel like an escape from the outside world. The park nearby was also quite beautiful and complemented the peaceful nature of the library.

			p <strong>The Architecture of Erik Gunnar Asplund</strong>: In this book, I learned that Asplund’s main inspiration for the design of the public library derived from neo-classical and functional ideals (example would be the geometric structure and stairs that could be described as Egyptian. The initial design of the building was to have a skylit dome on the top as Asplund wished for the building to be a metaphor for the mind, a token to the library’s purpose.  However, due to structural reasons, the design had to be shifted to becoming a “tall cylinder” since the dome would have been expensive and difficult to build (nevertheless, Asplund did his best to maintain the symbolic dimension of the building ). Furthermore, Asplund incorporates the contrast of light and dark between the “mysterious side stairs” and the inner cylinder to symbolize the relation of the known and the unknown.

			p <strong>Asplund</strong>: In this book, I learned that Asplund’s design was actually very similar to one of his previous designs, the Lister Court-House. In addition, Asplund’s plans for designing the public library changed quite drastically from creating a decorate dome structure to a tall cylinder with a few pictoral friezes. This is an example of how Asplund’s architectural ideals went through a maturation process while planning the library, transitioning from a classical style to a more functional approach in the final design.
